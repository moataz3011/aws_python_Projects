# Geometric Shape Calculator

This project offers a Python-based geometric shape calculator with classes for computing the area and perimeter of various 2D shapes: square, rectangle, triangle, circle, and regular hexagon.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Each shape is implemented in a separate module for better organization and reusability.
- **Shape Classes**: Includes classes for rectangle, square, triangle, circle, and regular hexagon, each with methods for calculating area and perimeter.
- **Main Module**: The main module orchestrates the execution of the program and provides tests for each shape class.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `main.py` to execute tests for each shape class.
3. Check the output to verify the correctness of area and perimeter calculations for different shapes.
