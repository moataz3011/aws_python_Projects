# Geometric Shape Calculator

This project offers a Python-based geometric shape calculator with classes for computing the area and perimeter of various 2D shapes: square, rectangle, triangle, circle, and regular hexagon.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Each shape is implemented in a separate module for better organization and reusability.
- **Shape Classes**: Includes classes for rectangle, square, triangle, circle, and regular hexagon, each with methods for calculating area and perimeter.
- **Main Module**: The main module orchestrates the execution of the program and provides tests for each shape class.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `main.py` to execute tests for each shape class.
3. Check the output to verify the correctness of area and perimeter calculations for different shapes.




# 3D Triple Decker Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a 3D variation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, providing an enhanced and challenging gameplay experience.

# How to Play
Players: 2 players.
Objective: Get three marks ('X' or 'O') in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, in any of the three dimensions.
Gameplay: Players take turns placing their marks on a 3D grid consisting of three layers, each containing a 3x3 grid.

# Features
Random Player Selection: The game randomly selects the starting player.
Clear Visual Representation: The game board is represented using ASCII art for easy visualization.
Winning Conditions: Checks for winning conditions in all three dimensions.
Tie Condition: Detects tie conditions when all positions on the board are filled without a winner.
Play Again Option: Players can choose to play again or exit after each game.
